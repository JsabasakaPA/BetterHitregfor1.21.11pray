# Notice
### **If you installed version `1.0.0` please update immediately**
### **That version contains a bug that can add up to 50ms to your set custom hitreg**

---

## Overview
BetterHitreg is an **open source client-side Fabric mod** for **Minecraft 1.19.4 – 1.21.8** that registers hits **before the server** making it *feel* as if you were low ping

---

## Features
- Designed for any **ping under 500ms**, with higher ping having a more noticeable difference
- Makes hits *feel* as if they land instantly, simulating a **0ms experience**.  
- Includes a **keybind to switch main hand** (default: `I`).  


---

## Safety
- **Not known to cause false flags or punishments from any anticheat**.  
- **Does not** provide any unfair technical advantage, all settings are purely cosmetic
- All custom hits are in **appearance only**, your actual hits are **not modified** in any way, only the way they are rendered and sound is affected
- Compatibility with specialized clients like Feather, Lunar, or Badlion is **uncertain**.  

---

## Tested On
The mod has been used safely on:  
- `mcpvp.club`  
- `pvplegacy.net`  
- `minemen.club`  
- `sharpness.gg` / `blotcraft.com`
