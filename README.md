## Overview
BetterHitreg is an **open source client-side Fabric mod** for **Minecraft 1.19.4 – 1.21.8** that registers hits **before the server** making it *feel* as if you were low ping

---

## Features
- Designed for any **ping under 500ms**, with higher ping having a more noticeable difference
- Makes hits *feel* as if they land instantly, simulating a **0ms experience**
- Includes a **keybind to switch main hand** (default: `I`)

---

## Safety
- ✅ **No known false flags or punishments from any anticheat have been recorded** and no features are designed to provide any unfair technical advantage
- ✅ All custom hits are in **appearance only**, your actual hits are **not modified** in any way, only the way they are rendered and sound is affected
- ⚠️ Compatibility with specialized clients like Feather, Lunar, or Badlion is **uncertain**

---

## Tested On
The mod has been used safely on:
- `mcpvp.club`
- `pvplegacy.net`
- `minemen.club`
- `sharpness.gg` / `blotcraft.com`
- `stray.gg`

> [!WARNING]
> These or any servers **may deem this as a rule-breaking mod**, please read the rules of your desired server before using
